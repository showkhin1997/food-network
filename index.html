            <p>
                Hi, You can Call Me a Food Lover but please do not call me a foodie. Your definition of foodie may be
                different than mine but in my mind, a foodie is pretentious about their food experiences and spends more
                time picking apart the pieces of a meal rather than enjoying the moment. I think of myself as a person
                who loves to eat (and drink) delicious things.

                <h2>Beef Kala Bhuna</h2>
                <p>Natives of Chittagong used to cover their fried dark and tendered beef dish using banana leaves and
                    packed it for long tours on foot, nowadays aluminium foil is used instead of the traditional banana
                    leaf. The first major innovation that led to what is now known as kala-bhuna was the use of special
                    spices and the long frying technique.</p>
